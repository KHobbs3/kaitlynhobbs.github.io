# Student Capstone Project Highlight

Our team of 3 developed a provincial database of long‐term care (LTC) homes and modelled COVID‐19 outbreaks in British Columbia. This work done as part of a capstone project at The University of British Columbia (UBC) under guidance from Statistics Canada has been [highlighted by UBC](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/why-data-science/data-stories/bringing-understanding-covid-19-outbreak-ontario).
