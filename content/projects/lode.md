The [Linkable Open Data Environment (LODE)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/lode/databases) is a government open data initiative to consolidate micro-data into singular, connective, geospatial databases. I contributed to the development of the LODE production pipeline and dissemination of several complete databases including:
* [The Open Database of Infrastructure (ODI)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/34-26-0003/342600032023001-eng.htm) - May 8, 2023 — Version 1.0
* [The Open Database of Education Facilities (ODEF)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/lode/databases/odef) - November 28, 2022 — Version 2.1 \& April 9, 2021 — Version 2.0
* [The Open Database of Healthcare Facilities (ODHF)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/lode/databases/odhf) - August 7, 2020 — Version 1.1
* [The Open Database of Addresses (ODA)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/lode/databases/oda) - April 29, 2021 — Version 1.0
