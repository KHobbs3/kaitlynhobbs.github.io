As part of the Fall 2023 [Research Training Program](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/research-training-program) through Charity Entrepreneurship, 16 of us from across the globe met virtually to research and discuss the topic of effective giving over 11-weeks. In it, we learned ways to prioritise cause areas, compared different intervention ideas within a single cause area, and evaluated plausibility and cost-effectiveness of seemingly promising new interventions.

This report investigates the plausibility of starting a new charity that leverages mass media to increase health-seeking and health-protecting behaviours in low-middle income countries.
