*Kelowna, Canada based discussion group, with meet-ups occuring in 4-week intervals.*

The aim of this casual discussion group is to generate individual thinking about giving meaningfully. As we will discuss, there is no need to be in a position to give substantially; small contributions in the form of time, money, or attention has the capacity to amount to big change.
