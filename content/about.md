I am a seasoned Data Scientist and Researcher with a diverse skill set and applied knowledge in spatial analysis, demographic analysis, and programmatic pipeline development. My recent participation in Charity Entrepreneurship's [Research Training Program](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/research-training-program) showcases my ability to tackle complex issues in diverse domains, including mass-media strategies, pain relief accessibility, and corporate campaigning.

My expertise extends technical experience in data science to addressing social challenges. I am able to lead projects, conduct impactful and actionable research, communicate with stakeholders and engage in community initiatives. With a strong commitment to transparency and effective communication, I can offer a valuable blend of practical skills and social responsibility to any project or opportunity.
