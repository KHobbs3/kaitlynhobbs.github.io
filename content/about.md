I work as a data scientist for the Data Exploration and Integration Lab, a geospatial data lab within Statistics Canada. In the Fall of 2023, I took a leave from this position to participate in Charity Entrepreneurship's Research Training Program where we worked on several projects investigating new charity ideas and current charity operations. The program emphasized building acuity for developing theories of change, conducting cost-effectiveness analyses, designing weighted factor models for decision-making, performing evidence reviews, and evaluating effective giving multipliers.
